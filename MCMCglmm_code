  # I have suppressed an example for a weakly informative prior for the probability scale with a logit link (for example if looking at probability of hatching, as in Buston & Elith 2011)

  ## V = the variance at the limit and nu = degree of belief parameter 
  ## V = 1*I is equivalent to the inverse gamma with shape and scale = nu/2
  ## the variance of FSL,MSL and anemone area are fixed at a small value (zero not allowed) because there is no within-group variance in these traits (a single measurement across the study period)
  G=list(G1=list(V=diag(7),nu=7, alpha.mu=rep(0,7),alpha.V=diag(25^2,7,7))))## G specifies prior for the random variance
## V = 1 and nu = 7 (where 7 is the number of variables) is a flat prior for the variances; nu = 1.002 would be inverse gamma with shape = scale = 0.001; ## alpha.mu is the parameter expanded mean, alpha.V is the parameter expanded variance
